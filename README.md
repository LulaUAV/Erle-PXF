Erle-PXF
===

Fork of the PXF board (http://github.com/diydrones/PXF) made by Erle Robotics.

This project is for developers, it will NOT be supported by the DIYDrones or Ardupilot suppoert forums for general users. This means we do not expect that this board will be plug and play, nor do we intend it to be.
